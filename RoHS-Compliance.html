                        the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic
                        equipment,&quot; will be enforced throughout the European Community from 1st
                        July 2006.<br /><br />Its aim is simple – to remove a total of six substances from electrical
                        and electronic equipment (EEE), thereby contributing to the protection
                        of human health and the environment.<br /><br />Although RoHS is a European Union (EU)
                        Directive, manufacturers of EEE
                        outside Europe must also abide by this legislation if the equipment they
                        produce is ultimately imported into a EU member state.<br /></p>
